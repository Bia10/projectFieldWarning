# Project: Field Warning
Project: Field Warning is a community-made RTS game centered around squad and company-scale warfare.

## Downloading and Installing
**We recommend using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) to download**;
it provides an easy way to synchronize with the latest changes. If it is
inconvenient to download, or you do not want to sign up, you can use another
Git client (like [Sourcetree](https://www.atlassian.com/software/sourcetree) or
just download a ZIP archive.
