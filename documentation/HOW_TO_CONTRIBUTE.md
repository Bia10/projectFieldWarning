Currently, we do not have a contribution pipeline in place - everyone has push rights to master. Despite this you are encouraged to do your work on a separate branch and integrate by submitting a pull request. 


CODERS:
We do code reviews. If you are submitting code, you will help both yourself and the other coders by submitting a pull request and waiting. Somebody will come by within two days, read through your code and give feedback - you get feedback, the reviewer gets to familiarize themselves with your corner of the system. If you merge your own code, we get neither of those benefits.

There is a code style guide in the coding-style.md file.


ARTISTS:
For art and mapping work, there is no review system in place. When you push your commits to master, please make sure that the game at the very least still compiles, ideally without warnings - otherwise you will force the person who comes after you to undo your work. If somebody wants to take on the role of integration engineer who reviews the commits of binary files by artists and makes sure they do not break the build, it will be greatly appreciated and awarded with privileges!
