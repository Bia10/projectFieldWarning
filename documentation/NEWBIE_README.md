If you have just joined the project, perhaps you need some guidance. This document will get you started.

The first thing you should do is get the project running on your machine. If any of these steps fail, do not hesitate to ask! Here's how:
- Download Unity version 2018.2.3(f1).
- Download the project. The simplest way is to press the green "download or clone" button in the github interface. A better way is to install the github app (or git, if you are familiar with it).
- Open Unity and import the project.
- In Unity, open the Scene/full-featured-scene file (white/black cube icon). Press the play button and try the game out.

After you have the project running, open trello and pick a task (or make one up yourself!). Hint: The tasks marked with green are meant to be beginner-friendly.

We use the following venues of communication:
- Trello (Tasks): https://trello.com/b/qXxCGXIW/pfw-beta
- Discord: https://discord.gg/ExQtQX4
- Github: https://github.com/FieldWarning/projectFieldWarning


Finally, the PEOPLE.md file contains a list of people you can turn to for assistance or questions. Of course you can also just ask in the general discord chats, but it helps to know who is who.
