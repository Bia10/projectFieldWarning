We use Trello for project management. It has two purposes - a way for contributors to easily find work, and a way to avoid multiple people accidentally implementing the same thing twice. Do not be shy to add your own tasks to Trello, especially if the topic you want to work on is not already there, or if something is blocking you (e.g. you are an artist who has made some buttons and now needs a coder to make the buttons do stuff).

We have three types of Trello cards:

-> Most columns consist of TASKS. Tasks are immediately actionable and small in scope, ideally an afternoon's work. 

-> EPICS have their own column. They are macro goals like "have working multiplayer". They mostly exist to give you ideas for future tasks and maybe hold those tasks as subgoals until they are actionable.

-> USER STORIES have their own column. They are smaller than epics but bigger than tasks. The format of a user story helps it stay the right size, since it is hard to describe an epic as a brief sequence of actions. They will help us write unit tests.

-> Anything not in the User stories or Epics column should be a TASK, meaning not blocked by prerequisites and can be done in a day (or longer if it is not possible to break it up any further).


For new contributors, we have tasks marked with green. These are easier and more suitable for getting your feet wet with the codebase and Unity
